Responsive design ensures that web applications render well on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes. As a developer, you will likely be asked to create a mobile-first application or add responsive design to an existing application. 


## Directions

First, you will use the Bootstrap CSS Framework to create a mobile responsive portfolio. How do you deliver this? Here are some guidelines:

* Create the following files files: `index.html`, `portfolio.html` and `contact.html`.

* Using Bootstrap, develop your portfolio site with the following items:

   * A navbar

   * A responsive layout

   * Responsive images

* The Bootstrap portfolio should minimize the use of media queries.

* Screenshots are provided as a reference in the `Assets/Images` folder. Your app does not need to be _exactly_ like the images. Use Bootstrap to create a similar, responsive layout.


### Minimum Requirements

* Functional, deployed application

* GitHub repository with README describing the project

* Navbar must be consistent on each page.

* Navbar on each page must contain links to Home/About, Contact, and Portfolio pages.

* All links must work.

* Must use semantic html.

* Each page must have valid and correct HTML. (use a validation service)

* Must contain your personalized information. (bio, name, images, links to social media, etc.)

* Submit an updated portfolio featuring Project 1 and two exemplary homework assignments.

* Submit an updated GitHub profile with pinned repositories featuring Project 1 and two exemplary assignments.

* Submit an updated resume

* Submit an updated LinkedIn profile

* Must properly utilize Bootstrap components and grid system.
